# EDA of IPL Auction 2022

In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset of IPL Auction 2022. This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. I explored this data as much as possible and plotted the results for visualization. Libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and some other Python libraries.
